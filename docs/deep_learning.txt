Deep Learning
============

It is easy to start a project and glide along until something better
comes along. Here are some tools to help you become skilled in whatever
you seek to learn.


* Do. In most languages there are nuances; a semi-colon in C, an 
inflection in Spanish. Don't cut and paste. Take the time to do the 
work yourself. Not only will attention to detail speed your growth
but it will deepen your understanding. If you just see a word or line
of code it does not tend to stick in your memory as well. If you write
it, type it, say it, and test it, you learn it.

* Be curious. Take your time and play. While there are lots of work
things that need to be done on a daily basis, if you associate play
with your learning your brain moves forward faster. The "feels good"
portion of life motivates you to return again and again. Avoid 
drudgery in your learning. It might not be easy, but make it fun.

* Dream. Keep sight of where this will take you. Have a goal that you 
really want to achieve. When times get tough and discouragment tries
to steal your joy, remember where you are going. Remember why you want
to get there. Taste success like cool water on a hot day. 

* Work. Lots of people have dreams but few do the work to achieve them.
Spend 15-45 minutes a day doing something towards your goal. Do your 
work in your best part of the day; the time your mind and energy is 
strongest. Create the space to work, say "no" to things that distract.
