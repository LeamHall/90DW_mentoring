Mentoring an on-line group -- Lessons in progress
=================================================

There are a lot of lessons to learn when trying to help others make
progress towards their goals. Here are the ones that I have focused 
on with the "Learn C the Hard Way" effort.

1. Accept that it isn't for everyone. 
Really, just because I like something doesn't mean anyone else cares. 
Let folks come and go as they please. However, that leads to number 2.

2. Set a barrier for entry. 
In this case, it's "Do you want this enough to spend $$ on a book?" I
tried to pick a book that provided both paper and video learning, and 
was reasonably priced. It also, mostly, focused on the basics, which 
is important. If someone doesn't buy the book then they are saying 
the effort isn't worth their time and money. That's fine. Just don't 
blow your time trying to make them want it.

3. Stay focused. 
In any computer subject there will be dozens of side-trails and rabbit
holes to wander down. Don't. Stick to the material at hand for the 
agreed up time frame. Don't confuse people with a bunch of things that 
excite you. It will just confuse them and kill their participation. 

4. Don't ego bomb someone else's group.
Corollary to #3, don't throw in a bunch of stuff when someone else is 
trying to keep a group focused. Form your own group. Don't kill someone
else's efforts. 

5. Pick a time-frame and stick to it. 
In this case it's 90 days. An arbitrary length of time that seems long
enough to make progress and short enough to persevere though if times
get tough. If someone comes in late, great! They can participate as best
they can and be ready for the next go round.

6. Don't save the world.
It ain't worth it and doesn't want to be saved. Have fun yourself. Do what
is fun for you. Otherwise you'll ruin everyone else's fun and be a general
boor. 

7. Decide on your message and go with it.
There are lots of mediocre messages out there. Pick one that you want to 
promote and go with it. Put it up on Meetup, e-mail, wherever. For example,
 my message is simply "It's all about you". Drive the same message home as
often as possible.

8. Value people by watching the time.
Show up a little early. Wrap things up on time. If folks want to hang out
and chat, let them. However, provide a solid emotional ending to the event
so those who want to leave don't feel guilty about doing so.
