Learn C the Hard Way from Zed Shaw
==================================

A group of us are going to take a 90 day challenge to (re-)learn C. We
are using the book "Learn C the Hard Way" by Zed A. Shaw. The book is 
currently available on Amazon and possibly at a bookstore near you.

The goal is to work through the book at your own pace, for 90 days. This
means you pick your level of commitment. If you can do 40 hours a week, 
more power to you! Most of us can do 15-60 minutes a day, tops. Maybe a
couple hours extra on the weekends. The result is not based on an external 
driver, it's all about you. Your choice, your level of commitment, your 
progress. The goal is honest participation; you will know more C at the end
than when you began. Where you go with that is up to you.
